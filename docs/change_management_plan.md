# **Change management plan**
This section contains the change management plan for our project. We will include how to train users to play/use our game, how we ensure it will integrate into existing ecosystems/software, and how we will ensure that issues are resolved promptly.
### *How will we train people to use it?*
* Around the Horn is simple and intuitive, so much so that you only press a singular button for the core gameplay mechanic (hitting). By providing clear instructions on naming your team, playing the game, and selecting the desired player for post-game stat changes, Around the Horn will be easy for any customer to learn. An easy demo of the game will provide a comprehensive overview of how to play the game. Because it is a roguelike, it is up to the customer/players to determine how to properly strategize. The simplicity of our game ensures that the customer will be able to pick it up very quickly without having to understand complex gameplay rules or mechanics.
### *How will we ensure it integrates withing their ecosystem/software?*
* Since Around the Horn is based in a web-browser, as long as they have a browser, it will integrate. We provide clear instructions on how to correctly install any software that is needed to visualize the game, and the rest occurs in the browser. No massive downloads, no GPU or power CPU required. Just the browser of their choice and a few steps to get the game up and running.
### *How will we ensure that any discovered issues are resolved?*
* With a very small development team, the customer will be able to reach out directly to the developers to notify them of any bugs or errors. If discovered, the developers will be able to promptly assess the errors and make corrections to the code where necessary. Since the game is a simple web-based interface, it is most likely that the errors will revolve around the stat modifiers and difficulty curve. With this in mind, the developers can actively stress test and check edge cases to find any possible bugs and patch them even before the customer is able to discover it themselves.
