# Around the Horn
### Electric Spaghetti

Around the Horn is a rogue-like baseball themed management game. Take a team of 9 players from the beginning of their career, and create the perfect World Series winning team!

Players will have stats that can be modified by random items and trinkets, and teams can be defined with whole-team items called “mementos”. These stats, items, and mementos determine the type of hitter a player is, increasing your chances to score some runs. Adjusting your team’s stats and equipping the correct items is the key to success.

The game is web-based and a demo for now, but there are plans to bring the game to a proper game engine (post-class).
