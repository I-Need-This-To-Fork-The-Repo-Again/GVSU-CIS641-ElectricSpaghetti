# Around the Horn
### Electric Spaghetti

Around the Horn is a rogue-like baseball themed management game. Take a team of 9 players from the beginning of their career, and create the perfect World Series winning team!

Players will have stats that can be modified at the end of the game by stat changs, which come in different tiers of rarity. Increasing your teams success to exceed your ever-more-difficult opponents is the key to success! Be warned, though, that with sometimes improvement in one area requires sacrifice in another.

The game is web-based and a demo for now, but there are plans to bring the game to a proper game engine (post-class).
